As he was being\n","evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and\n","developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were\n","started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became\n","responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to\n","be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the\n","50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that\n","he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening\n","without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his\n","arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the\n","setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to\n","the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and\n","amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval\n","worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and\n","bibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became\n","very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK\n","to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic\n","echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular\n","systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the\n","inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe\n","aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was\n","aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in\n","his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was\n","discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off\n","pressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred\n","back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal\n","sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was\n","continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and\n","improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no\n","shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was\n","maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal\n","atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in\n","the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s\n","upon transfer to the floor.
